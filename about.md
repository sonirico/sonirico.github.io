### Profiling

I am a web & game developer constantly in the making. I studied both technical
degrees of Webapp development and Networking & System Management. The former 
taught me the basics of programming to which I immediately fell in love, whereas 
the latter introduced me to UX systems which I have never stopped to use from then on.

My first little-big project was an attempt of shoot'em up game, which I started in
cooperation with [@rubendelblanco][2], who I would call my mentor. It is still 
available in sourceforge and even there is a [~~boring~~ gameplay][3], however I would recommend 
not to peek such expired spaghetti code.

Regarding game stuff, I am currently directing my learning to **ECS** (Entity-Component-System) 
pattern design, since standard OPP/POJO for game development is getting rather
verbose. In regards to web based projects, I am specialized on **Django** (Python) and
**Laravel** (PHP), although Vanilla style and CodeIgniter are still on the box 
depending each project size. I also have experience dealing with **Wordpress** 
CMS, with what [my other website][4] is still powered, by the way. As you may have realized, I have
a fond for back-end. After all, I enjoy logic and databases, and prefer others to deal with
UI and more artistic stuff.


### Background & misc hobbies

I was born and raised in [Ponferrada, El Bierzo][1], an historical 
*shire* whose main source of profit was coal mining industry. Recent tecnology
enhacements have rendered such labor obsolete, so poverty levels have hazardously
increased during the last decades. `//TODO: Add donate button`. 

Besides from requesting help to others pitifully, I am a passionated long-distance
runner and a former gamer - I like to fall back into sometimes, though. Finally, I am currently
stuyding languages, hobbyistly though.
